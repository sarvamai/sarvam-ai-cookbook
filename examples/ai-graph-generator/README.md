## AI Graph Generator
An intelligent graph and chart generator that transforms natural language prompts into visual representations using Python and Matplotlib, powered by Sarvam AI. The AI-generated plotting code is executed locally to render the chart.

### ✨ Features
- Intelligent Conversion: Converts simple English prompts into detailed visual charts.
- Diverse Chart Types: Supports the generation of bar, line, pie, and scatter plots.
- AI-Powered Understanding: Leverages the Sarvam AI API to accurately interpret user intent.
- Flexible Data Handling: Includes capabilities for random and sample data generation.

### 🚀 Getting Started
