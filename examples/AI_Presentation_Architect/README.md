# AI Presentation Architect

This project is a web-based application built with Streamlit that uses Sarvam AI's language models to automatically generate complete, multilingual PowerPoint presentations from a single topic.

Users can input a topic, choose a target language from a list of supported Indian languages, and receive a downloadable `.pptx` file containing generated slides with translated content and audio narration.

## Features

- **Interactive Web UI:** A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Uses Sarvam's Chat API to generate relevant titles and bullet points for each slide.
- **Multilingual Translation:** Leverages Sarvam's Translate API to convert the entire presentation into 8 supported languages.
- **Automated PowerPoint Creation:** Uses the `python-pptx` library to dynamically build a downloadable `.pptx` file.
- **Text-to-Speech Narration:** Includes audio narration for each slide in the selected regional language, generated by Sarvam's TTS API.
